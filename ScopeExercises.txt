1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
x = 1;
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = function(a, b, c) {
                    var x = 10;
                    document.write(x);
                    document.write(a);

                    var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a;
                        document.write(b);
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
}

    f(a,b,c);
    document.write(b);
 }

c(8,9,10);
document.write(b);
document.write(x);
}
